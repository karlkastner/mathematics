I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

Oh dear. I can't decide if the expression above is positive,
negative, or zero. So this comparison test won't be `true'.

There should've been a colon after the condition.
I shall pretend that one was there.

A forbidden `outer' token occurred in skipped text.
This kind of error happens when you say `if...' and forget
the matching `fi'. I've inserted a `fi'; this might work.
