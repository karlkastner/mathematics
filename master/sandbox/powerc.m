% power method for complex or multiple first eigenvcector

% power method for symmetric
% power method for asymmetric -> slower convergence ?
% power method for duplicate eignvalues -> two different start values
% power method for complex eigenpairs -> 3 successive iterates are linear dependent, see below
% power method for smallest value -> shift by lambda max
% power method for second value -> find first and than deflate / orthogonalise to first vector

function [l1 l2] = powerc(A)
%A = diag([2 2 1]); %fails (sign), raleigh does work
A = diag([2 -2 1]); % fails (swaps complex with real part), raleigh does not work
A = [0 0 -2; 0 1 0; -2 0 0]; % succeeds, raileigh fails
	% unique largest : second 2x2 eigenvalue is zero, compare with raleigh quotient
	% two equal : second 2x2 eigenvalue is zero, compare with raleigh quotient
	% two equal with opposit sign, works
