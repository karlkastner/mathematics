1)
- cg is exact in n steps (exact arithmetic)
- less storage than gauss
- approximate solution with fewer steps
2) notations
3) algorihtm in detail
- relation to gauss
- computation of approximate eigenvalues (eigenvectors?)
- variant for asymmetric systems (cgs?)
4)
- relation to steepest descent?
- relation to gauss
- minimises the error | x_* - x_i|
