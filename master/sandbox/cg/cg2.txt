5) basis relations
	R'R = D
	P'AP = D
- meaning of tick marks in 5:8b
printing error in 5:9

6) convergence
- cg as minimisation method for f(x) = e'Ae, e = x_* - x_i = A^-1 r_i
- error is monotonically decreasing
7) modification
	typo valve instead of value
	c_i+1 = 1 + b_i * c_i
	x^bar_i+1 = 1/c_i+1 x_i + b_i c_i / c_i+1 x^bar_i
	x^bar also converges monotonically
	two typos in last paragraph of either bar or indices wrong s7
8) round of errors
	typo between 8.5 and 8.6
	1/l_max < a_i  < 1/l_min
	large a_i / a_i+1 deteriorate results
	- start vectors close to v of l_min always converge
	8.2) relaxation by b_i = 0 => ri=pi: is this steepest descent?
	a_i = p_i' r_i / (p_i A p_i) is better than r_i' r_i / (p_i A p_i), similar b_i = - r_i+1'A p_i / p_i A p_i
9) discussion of scale factors to keep p_i of similar length (1 is best)
10) asymmetric and singular systems
	chose B*A instead of A'*A to get a symmetric matrix (similar to eliminating the bc prior to applying the algorithm)
