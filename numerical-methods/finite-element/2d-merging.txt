requires edge -> triangle, and point -> triangle relation (or count, relation required, when edges and points from the end are to be brought forward)

for each element
	set mergeflag to 1
for each triangle
	if not to be merged, reset merge flag of parent
for each triangle
	if has children and to be merged
	- set neighbour flags of children neighbours to point to the parent
	- if last on edge, remove edge and inbetween point
	- move spaces of children to empty list
for each merged triangle
	remesh (necessary, if neighbours are green)
	can be simplified by implementing blue triangles (3 2-side options in 2D, 6 2-side options in 3d, 3-side options in 3-d )
for each triangle in the empty lisst
	replace it from the end
